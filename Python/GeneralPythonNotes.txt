General Python Notes

Added Numba example at Reference/NumbaMultiThread.py
    pip install numba
    Cuda functionality seems to be available only through the Ananconda framework

Added PyCuda example at Reference/PyCudaRef.py
    pip install pycuda
    Got an error from the nvcc compiler that cl.exe was not on path.
        Added 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin' to my user Path environment variable and restarted Visual Studio Code
    This ran just fine, but PyLint seems to have trouble seeing pycuda functions and shows errors
        Found out this was because PyLint does not import C functions because of a security feature
        Disabled it by adding setting to User Settings:
            "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
                "--unsafe-load-any-extensions=yes"
            ]

PYTHONPATH must be set with additional directories to find Python modules
    Added one entry for the UberProject/Python directory to find all modules in that directory

Got importing my other Python modules in the Python directory to work through Cygwin's Python
    Needed to add another path to PYTHONPATH environment variable
    Used /cygdrive/c/... as second entry that pointed to the same place as the Windows based path entry
    Multiple items are separated by a ':' on Cygwin, but ';' on Windows
    Trick was to use a ';' first followed by a ':'
        Windows Python just ignores the bad path after the semicolon and Cygwin Python ignores the two ('C:' followed by rest) bad paths and uses the one immediately after the second ':'
